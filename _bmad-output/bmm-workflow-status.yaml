# Summary
# ======
# Overall Progress: 60% Complete (3/5 phases completed, with partial completion in Solutioning)
# Key Findings:
# - Documentation phase fully completed with comprehensive artifacts
# - Discovery phase skipped as project already well-defined
# - Planning phase completed for system components
# - Solutioning phase partially completed (architecture exists, but epics/stories and test design needed)
# - Implementation phase not yet started
# - Project is 85% complete per README.md, indicating significant implementation work already done

# Next Steps:
# ===========
# 1. Complete create-epics-and-stories (required)
# 2. Complete test-design (recommended)
# 3. Complete implementation-readiness (required)
# 4. Begin sprint-planning (required)
# 5. Validate that existing implementation work aligns with documented architecture and requirements
